# NSU CSE311 Database Course Project

This project was developed for the CSE311 (Database Course) at North South University. The primary focus of this project was to learn how to integrate a website with MySQL using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases a beginner-level website that my teammates and I developed.

# Features
- **Home, About, Course, Enroll**: Four main pages with core functionalities.
- **Login/Register**: Users must create an account or log in to access course enrollment.
- **Admin Panel**: A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operator was implemented for managing student information.
